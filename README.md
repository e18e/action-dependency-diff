# e18e/action-dependency-diff

> A GitHub action for reporting differences in dependencies between two branches or commits.

## What it does

This action compares dependencies between your base branch and current branch, analyzing potential security and maintenance concerns:

- ðŸ”’ **Provenance changes** - Detects loss of provenance
- âœ… **Trusted publisher changes** - Detects loss of trusted publish status
- ðŸ“ˆ **Dependency growth** - Warns when dependency count increases significantly
- ðŸ“¦ **Install size** - Warns when package size increases significantly
- ðŸ”„ **Duplicate versions** - Detects packages with multiple versions installed

## Usage

```yaml
name: Dependency Diff

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  diff_dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Create Diff
        uses: e18e/action-dependency-diff@main
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Required | Default |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `base-ref` | Base ref to compare against (defaults to main or PR target) | No | Auto-detected from PR or `main` |
| `github-token` | The GitHub token for authentication | Yes | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `pr-number` | The number of the pull request to comment on | Yes | `${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` |
| `dependency-threshold` | Threshold for warning about significant increase in number of dependencies | No | `10` |
| `size-threshold` | Threshold (in bytes) for warning about significant increase in package size | No | `100000` |
| `duplicate-threshold` | Threshold for warning about packages with multiple versions | No | `1` |
| `base-packages` | Glob pattern for base branch pack files (e.g., `"./base-packs/*.tgz"`) | No | None |
| `source-packages` | Glob pattern for source branch pack files (e.g., `"./source-packs/*.tgz"`) | No | None |
| `pack-size-threshold` | Threshold (in bytes) for warning about significant increase in total pack size | No | `50000` |

## Example with custom inputs

```yaml
- name: Create Diff
  uses: e18e/action-dependency-diff@main
  with:
    base-ref: 'develop'
    dependency-threshold: '5'
    size-threshold: '50000'
```

## Package Bundle Analysis

In addition to analyzing dependency changes, this action can optionally compare the actual bundle sizes of your packages by examining `npm pack` outputs. This provides insights into the **bundle size** (what gets published) rather than just the **install size** (what gets installed with dependencies).

### Package Inputs

The action accepts glob patterns to locate package tarballs for comparison:

- **`base-packages`** - Glob pattern for base branch pack files (e.g., `"./base-packs/*.tgz"`)
- **`source-packages`** - Glob pattern for source branch pack files (e.g., `"./source-packs/*.tgz"`)
- **`pack-size-threshold`** - Threshold in bytes for warning about significant pack size increases

> [!NOTE]
> Package bundle analysis only runs when both `base-packages` and `source-packages` are provided. If these inputs are not set, this feature is skipped entirely.
