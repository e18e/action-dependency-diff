# @e18e/action-dependency-diff

> A GitHub action for reporting differences in dependencies between two branches or commits.

## What it does

This action compares dependencies between your base branch and current branch, analyzing potential security and maintenance concerns:

- ðŸ”’ **Provenance changes** - Detects loss of provenance
- âœ… **Trusted publisher changes** - Detects loss of trusted publish status
- ðŸ“ˆ **Dependency growth** - Warns when dependency count increases significantly
- ðŸ“¦ **Install size** - Warns when package size increases significantly
